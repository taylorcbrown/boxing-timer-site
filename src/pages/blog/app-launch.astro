  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What Makes Boxing Timer Champ Different?</h2>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    Boxing Timer Champ was built from the ground up with a focus on what fighters and coaches actually need during training. Here's what sets us apart:
  </p>
  
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Fully Customizable Rounds and Rest Periods:</strong> Set your own round duration, rest period, and number of rounds. Train exactly the way you want to.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio and Visual Alerts:</strong> Customize warning alerts to prepare for round transitions. Never get caught off guard again.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean, Distraction-Free UI:</strong> Large, easy-to-read timer display that's visible from across the gym.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable Performance:</strong> The timer runs perfectly in the background, even when your screen is locked.</li>
    <li><strong>No Subscriptions:</strong> Boxing Timer Champ is a one-time purchase. No recurring fees, no hidden costs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Developed by Fighters, for Fighters</h2>
  
  <p class="mb-4">
    As boxing enthusiasts ourselves, we created Boxing Timer Champ out of necessity. We couldn't find a timer app that met all our needs without unnecessary complications or subscriptions. So we built our own, focusing on the essentials while making sure every feature is polished to perfection.
